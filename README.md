# Slack Notifications Skillet

This skillet configures HTTP notifications to a Slack webhook for monitoring of
events on a PAN-OS firewall.  This posts important system, threat, and traffic
log entries to a channel of your choice, making monitoring of a home firewall
(or any low traffic firewall) easy.  This is also intended to demonstrate how
to integrate PAN-OS with a typical HTTP webhook. 

## Setting up the Slack webhook

For more information on Slack webhooks, see the
[Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks) API documentation.

### Create a Slack app

Create a Slack app by clicking [here](https://api.slack.com/apps/new).

### Enable Incoming Webhooks for your app

On the Your Apps page, edit your app, then click
**Add Features and Functionality**, and select **Incoming Webhooks**.

![Add webhook feature](doc/add_webhook_feature.png)

On the next page, toggle **Activate Incoming Webhooks**, and click
**Add New Webhook to Workspace**.

![Activate webhook](doc/activate_webook.png)

This is where you specify what channel messages are going to be delivered to.
For testing, select **Slackbot, which is private to you** to ensure that
messages only get delivered to you during testing.

You may want to additionally create a dedicated channel.

## Usage

### Parameters

- **webhook_uri_format**: This is the portion of the generated webhook URL
  without `https://hooks.slack.com/`.
- **profile_name**: Name of the HTTP server profile that gets created.
- **fw_name**: String prefix that gets added to messages posted to the Slack
  channel.  This is useful if you have multiple firewalls sending events to a
  single channel.

### Outputs

Running this skillet will configure:

- An HTTP server profile for the Slack webhookâ€˜s URL
- Critical and high system logs to the Slack webhook
- Logging profile to forward critical and high threat and Wildfire events to the
  webhook
- Logging profile to forward traffic events to the webhook

### Intended Usage

Critical and high system logs are forwarded to the channel using the 
*Slack System Logs* profile.

![Slack System Logs](doc/slack_system_logs.png)

Critical and high threat and Wildfire events are forwarded to the channel using
the *Slack Default* profile.  Use this profile as the default logging profile
for rules, only forwarding events that need immediate admin follow up.

![Slack Default](doc/slack_default.png)

All traffic matches are forwarded to the channel by the *Slack Outbound Alert*.
Use this profile on rules to notify the admin of traffic to known compromised
hosts, or any other traffic you want to know about immediately.
